### Custom Shortcuts for Google Maps

Custom keyboard shortcuts for Google Maps. Shortcuts can be customized from the pop up. You can define multiple keys separated by commas (e.g. `f, t, y`), and use control, shift, and alt keys as modifiers by appending them to a key with '+' (e.g. `alt + a`, `ctrl + shift + s`). The defaults are as follows.

| Key          | Function                      |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
|  f           | Toggle street view            |
|  q, alt + a  | Go back (exit menus etc.)     |
|  v           | Switch satellite/default view |
|  g           | Toggle imagery/explore        |

#### Known issues
